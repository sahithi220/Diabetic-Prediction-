# Diabetic-Prediction-
Diabetes prediction ML project using the PIMA dataset. It analyzes features like glucose, BMI, age, and blood pressure to predict diabetes. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and accuracy results for early health risk detection.
Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an accurate and reliable machine learning model that can classify whether a person is diabetic or not. This solution can support healthcare applications and act as a basis for more advanced medical prediction systems.

üìä Dataset & Features

The dataset includes variables such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose level

Blood pressure

Skin thickness

Insulin level

BMI

Diabetes pedigree function

Age


These features are preprocessed to handle missing values, scale values, and improve model performance.

üß† Machine Learning Model

Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are evaluated. The final model is selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix results. Data is split into training and testing sets to ensure proper validation.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python

NumPy & Pandas

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook


üìê Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


3. Feature Selection & Scaling


4. Model Building & Training


5. Model Evaluation


6. Prediction & Visualization



‚úÖ Output

The project outputs whether a person is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0) along with performance metrics and visualized graphs for better understanding.
